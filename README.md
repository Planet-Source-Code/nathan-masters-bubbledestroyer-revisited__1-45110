## BubbleDestroyer Revisited


</div>

### Description

I was just looking through some old files, and stumbled across my old BubbleDestroyer code, the first game that I ever finished! Well, I started it up, and I just could not stand the flashing and jittering, so I fixed it. I also modified a few other things. Enjoy!

(BubbleDestroyer is an asteroids-style game. Sorry to all you MJ fans!)
